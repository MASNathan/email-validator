This is an easy way to check if a email address is acceptable so you can avoid fake/invalid users on your database.

What this API does is check if the email address is correctly formatted, is from a disposable or temporary service and the domain is reachable. This way you can filter out spam and one-shot accounts decreasing the rate of fake or invalid accounts on your database.
